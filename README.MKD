- 🌓 **Dark/Light Mode**: Switch themes for comfortable viewing
- 📱 **Fully Responsive**: Works perfectly on desktop, tablet, and mobile

### Advanced Features
- ⚠️ **Macro Detection**: Alerts if suspiciously consistent patterns are detected
- 🚫 **Debounce Filter**: Automatically filters accidental double-clicks (< 10ms)
- 📤 **Export to CSV**: Download all your statistics for analysis
- 🔗 **Share Results**: Generate shareable links with your performance data
- 💾 **Auto-Save Records**: Your best scores persist across sessions

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Option 1: Direct Use
1. Download the `index.html` file
2. Open it in any modern web browser
3. Start clicking or pressing keys!

### Option 2: Local Server
```bash
# Using Python 3
python -m http.server 8000

# Using Node.js
npx http-server

# Then open http://localhost:8000
```

## 📖 How to Use

### Getting Started
1. **Select a Mode**: Choose between Free Mode or timed challenges (5s, 10s, 30s)
2. **Click or Press**: Click anywhere in the test area or press any key
3. **Watch Your Stats**: Monitor your CPS, timing, and performance in real-time

### Understanding the Modes

#### Free Mode
- No time limit
- Perfect for practice and warming up
- CPS calculated from when you start
- Switch between inputs freely

#### Timed Modes (5s, 10s, 30s)
- Countdown before starting
- Fixed duration test
- Records are saved automatically
- Compare with your personal bests

### Input Types

**Left Click** 🟢
- Primary mouse button
- Continues test when active
- Green indicator in history

**Right Click** 🔴
- Secondary mouse button
- Context menu disabled during test
- Red indicator in history

**Keyboard Keys** 🔵
- Any keyboard key
- Automatically resets when switching keys
- Blue indicator in history

## 📊 Statistics Explained

### CPS (Clicks Per Second)
Your clicking speed calculated in real-time. Average human CPS is around 6.5.

### Time Between Inputs
Measured in milliseconds (ms). Lower is faster!

### Comparison Badge
- **Above Average**: 20%+ faster than 6.5 CPS
- **Average**: Within 20% of 6.5 CPS
- **Below Average**: 20%+ slower than 6.5 CPS

### Macro Warning ⚠️
Appears if the system detects suspiciously consistent timing (standard deviation < 5ms), which may indicate auto-clicker usage.

## 🎮 Tips for Better Performance

1. **Warm Up First**: Use Free Mode to practice before timed tests
2. **Find Your Rhythm**: Some people click faster with different techniques
3. **Relax Your Hand**: Tension slows you down
4. **Try Different Fingers**: Two-finger clicking can be faster
5. **Practice Regularly**: Like any skill, consistency improves performance

## 🛠️ Technical Details

### Browser Compatibility
- ✅ Chrome/Edge (recommended)
- ✅ Firefox
- ✅ Safari
- ✅ Opera
- ✅ Any modern browser with ES6 support

### Technologies Used
- Pure HTML5
- CSS3 with animations and gradients
- Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+)
- Canvas API for performance graphs
- Web Audio API for sound effects
- LocalStorage API for data persistence

### Performance
- Lightweight: Single HTML file (~50KB)
- No external dependencies
- No internet connection required
- Smooth 60 FPS animations
- Efficient DOM updates

## 🔧 Customization

You can easily customize the app by modifying these constants in the JavaScript:

```javascript
const MAX_HISTORY = 50;        // Number of inputs to store
const DEBOUNCE_TIME = 10;      // Minimum ms between clicks
const AVERAGE_CPS = 6.5;       // Comparison baseline
const MACRO_THRESHOLD = 5;     // Clicks to check for macros
```

### Color Themes
Modify the CSS gradient in the `body` selector:

```css
/* Dark theme */
background: linear-gradient(135deg, #1a2a6c, #b21f1f, #fdbb2d);

/* Light theme */
background: linear-gradient(135deg, #667eea, #764ba2, #f093fb);
```
